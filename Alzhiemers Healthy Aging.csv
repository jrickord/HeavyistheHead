CI describes the level of uncertainty of an estimate and specifies the range in which the true value is likely to fall. These reports use a 95% level of significance, which means that 95% of the time, the true value falls within these boundaries. When comparing prevalence of variables across states or years, we recommend the use of confidence intervals. If the confidence intervals overlap, the difference is not statistically significant.","","Measure Definitions"
